The basic features are in place: registration, login, and user information display. The Transcendence project, developed at school 42, integrates into this platform by adding an innovative and interactive dimension. Its main objective is to create, directly on the site, a multiplayer Pong game accessible to all, with real-time game management through websockets. It also integrates social features like chat, invitations, tournaments between users and personalized profile management. This project not only enriches the user experience, but also modernizes the site by promoting exchange and friendly competition. Finally, Transcendence offers an environment conducive to collaboration and mastery of web development tools, while strengthening the community spirit within the platform.",
