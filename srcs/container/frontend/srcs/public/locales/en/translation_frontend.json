The basic features are in place: registration, login, and viewing user information. The Transcendence project, developed at 42 school, integrates into this platform by adding an innovative and interactive dimension. Its main goal is to create, directly on the website, a multiplayer Pong game accessible to everyone, with real-time match management thanks to websockets. It also includes social features such as chat, invitations, tournaments between users, and personalized profile management. This project not only enriches the user experience but also modernizes the site by promoting interaction and friendly competition. Finally, Transcendence provides an environment ideal for collaboration and mastery of web development tools, while strengthening the community spirit within the platform.",
